# Stack and Queue Implementation

This repository contains the basic structure for implementing a Stack and Queue in C++. You are required to implement the missing details of these classes. Below are the instructions for implementing the classes.

## Stack Class

### 1. Stack.h

The `Stack` class is declared in the `Stack.h` header file. This file contains the class definition and method declarations. You should not modify this file.

### 2. Stack.cpp

In the `Stack.cpp` source file, you will need to implement the methods declared in `Stack.h`. These methods include:
- Constructor (`Stack::Stack()`)
- Destructor (`Stack::~Stack()`)
- `push` method (`void Stack::push(int value)`)
- `peek` method (`int Stack::peek() const`)
- `pop` method (`void Stack::pop()`)
- `empty` method (`bool Stack::empty() const`)

Please implement these methods by following the provided comments and specifications in `Stack.h`. You are responsible for handling errors and corner cases as needed.

## Queue Class

### 1. Queue.h

The `Queue` class is declared in the `Queue.h` header file. This file contains the class definition and method declarations. You should not modify this file.

### 2. Queue.cpp

In the `Queue.cpp` source file, you will need to implement the methods declared in `Queue.h`. These methods include:
- Constructor (`Queue::Queue()`)
- Destructor (`Queue::~Queue()`)
- `enqueue` method (`void Queue::enqueue(int value)`)
- `dequeue` method (`void Queue::dequeue()`)
- `front` method (`int Queue::front() const`)
- `empty` method (`bool Queue::empty() const`)

Please implement these methods by following the provided comments and specifications in `Queue.h`. You are responsible for handling errors and corner cases as needed.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.
